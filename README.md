### About the project :

</p>

1. **First stage:** Probability questions and their answers.
2. **Second stage:** Some programming questions in Python, in jupyter notebooks, using some of the libraries (numpy,pandas,..).
3. **Third stage:** I picked two datasets,
   - First one: Computers dataset, I used this dataset to predict their prices by other features such as: Ram, Weight, Screen Resolution...
   - Second one: Flight passengers, I used this dataset to classify the passengers satisfaction of their flight.
